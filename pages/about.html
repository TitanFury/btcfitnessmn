                    Our boys worked with Micah twice a week over the past spring and summer. It was a great transformation of core growth and overall strength. From this, their confidence grew helping them to be more successful in their sports, especially in basketball. The intensity of the work outs were unlike anything they had participated in before which is why their bodies gained so much from it. They learned many new ways to work out, in a safe manner for their ages and growing bodies. It gave them a great sense of satisfaction to see what hard work and proper training can do for a young athlete and that hard work pays off in many ways. The boys have a great respect for Micah as he lives what he teaches. They see him as a role model for what superior training provides and desire the same thing, and work harder for him as they believe in what he teaches. <i class="icon-quotes-right"></i></div>
