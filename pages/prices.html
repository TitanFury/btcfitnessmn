              I have had Micah Watkins as my personal trainer for over 18 months
              now. I will try to put into words how pleased and happy I am with
              what an effective, knowledgeable and caring trainer he is. He is
              able to make every work-out different from the last, so the
              routines never get boring at all. He is able to push me a little
              harder every time too. He does seem to know my limits, and does
              sternly but gently encourage me to get there. He has truly helped
              me build on my own self confidence in achieving goals that I
              didn’t think possible. I feel that it is very important for a
              client to have a positive connection with their trainer in order
              to succeed. I believe that Micah absolutely has the best interest
              in his client’s well being and physical health and does and will
              do anything in his power to see the client achieve it. I have
              worked with other trainers in my life and have never stuck with
              them. They gave me the feeling that they simply didn’t really care
              and were simply putting in their time. Where I do feel and know
              that Micah does sincerely care about you as a person. He is truly
              caring and very professional at his job. I would highly recommend
              Micah to anyone, no matter what age or gender to have as their
              Personal Trainer. I couldn’t be happier. <i
